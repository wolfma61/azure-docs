## Speech Recognition Using Microphone

The code snippet below shows how to recognize speech input from the microphone in the default language (`en-US`).

## Speech Recognition From a File

The code snippet below shows how to recognize speech input from a file in the default language (`en-US`),
using the factory's `CreateSpeechRecognizerWithFileInput` member function.
The audio format needs to be WAV / PCM with a single channel (mono) and 16 KHz sampling rate.

## Speech Recognition Using a Customized Model

The [Custom Speech Service (CRIS)](https://www.cris.ai/) allows to customize Microsoft's speech-to-text engine for your application.
The snippet below shows how to recognize speech from a microphone using your CRIS model;
fill in your CRIS subscription key and your own deployment ID before running it.
